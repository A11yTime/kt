  <h1>AI Basics: A Beginner’s Guide</h1>

  <p>
    Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science focused on building systems capable of performing tasks
    that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include problem-solving, decision-making, understanding language,
    recognizing patterns, and learning from experience.

    <h2>1. What is Artificial Intelligence?</h2>
    <p>
      At its core, AI enables machines to simulate human-like intelligence. Rather than being explicitly programmed for
      every scenario, AI systems can learn from data, adapt to new inputs, and improve over time.

    <h2>2. Types of AI</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Narrow AI (Weak AI):</strong> Designed for a specific task (e.g., voice assistants, spam filters).</li>
      <li><strong>General AI (Strong AI):</strong> Theoretical AI with the ability to perform any intellectual task a human can do.</li>
      <li><strong>Superintelligent AI:</strong> A future concept where AI surpasses human intelligence in all aspects.</li>
    </ul>
