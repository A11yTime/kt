        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Deep Learning (DL) is a subset of machine learning (ML) that uses artificial neural networks (ANNs)
          with multiple layers — hence the term "deep". It enables machines to automatically learn hierarchical
          patterns from vast amounts of data. From powering voice assistants like Siri to enabling self-driving cars
          and revolutionizing medical diagnostics, DL has become a cornerstone of modern artificial intelligence (AI).

        <h2>1. What is Deep Learning?</h2>
        <p>
          Deep Learning is a class of machine learning techniques that use deep neural networks — computational models
          composed of multiple layers of nodes (neurons) — to model complex patterns and representations in data.
        </p>
        <p>
          While traditional machine learning often requires manual feature engineering, deep learning models automatically
          learn features from raw input data, which significantly improves performance on tasks like image recognition,
          speech processing, and natural language understanding.
